To work *outside of this tutorial* you need to download the following data file:

* [album_sales.csv](https://www.discovr.rocks/csv/album_sales.csv)

Set up an `r rstudio()` project in the way that [I recommend in this video](https://youtu.be/mqT7c17tofE?si=R0aSApz66fGQKESl), and save the data files to the folder within your project called [data]{.alt}. Place this code in the first code chunk in your `r quarto()` document:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
album_tib <- here::here("data/album_sales.csv") |> read_csv()
```
