\title{discovr: Resources for Discovering Statistics Using R and RStudio (Field, 2023)}
\description{
The \code{discovr} package contains interactive \code{learnr} tutorials and datasets that accompany my textbook \href{https://www.discovr.rocks/}{Discovering Statistics Using R and RStudio}.
}
\section{Who is the package aimed at?}{


Anyone teaching from or reading \href{https://www.discovr.rocks/}{Discovering Statistics Using R and RStudio} should find these resources useful.
}

\section{Interactive tutorials}{


\strong{Getting started}:

I recommend working through \href{https://milton-the-cat.rocks/learnr/r/r_getting_started/}{this tutorial} on how to install, set up and work within R and RStudio before starting the interactive tutorials.

\strong{Running a tutorial}:

To run each tutorial execute

\code{learnr::run_tutorial("name_of_tutorial", package = "discovr")}

Replacing \code{name_of_tutorial} with the name in bold below. For example, to load the tutorial \code{discovr_02} execute:

\code{learnr::run_tutorial("discovr_02", package = "discovr")}
\itemize{
\item \strong{discovr_01}: Introducing R, RStudio and Quarto: What is R, tour of RStudio and Quarto, getting help, installing packages, coding style and loading packages
\item \strong{discovr_02}: Code fundamentals: Functions and objects, packages and functions, style, data types.
\item \strong{discovr_03}: The tidyverse: tidy and messy data, tibbles, adding and selecting variables, filtering cases.
\item \strong{discovr_04}: Summarizing data: mean, median, variance, standard deviation, interquartile range,  normal and bootstrap confidence intervals, tables of summary statistics. Includes an interactive app demonstrating what a confidence interval is.
\item \strong{discovr_05}: Visualizing data. The \code{ggplot2} package, boxplots, plotting means, violin plots, scatterplots, grouping by colour, grouping using facets, adjusting scales, adjusting positions.
\item \strong{discovr_06}: The beast of bias. Restructuring data from messy to tidy format (and back). Spotting outliers using histograms and boxplots. Calculating \emph{z}-scores (standardizing scores). Writing your own function. Using \emph{z}-scores to detect outliers. Q-Q plots. Calculating skewness, kurtosis and the number of valid cases. Grouping summary statistics by multiple categorical/grouping variables.
\item \strong{discovr_07}: Associations. Plotting data with \code{GGally}. Pearson's \emph{r}, Spearman's Rho, Kendall's tau, robust correlations. Using \code{display()} to round output more flexibly.
\item \strong{discovr_08}: The general linear model (GLM). Visualizing the data, fitting GLMs with one and two predictors. Viewing model parameters with \code{broom}, model parameters, standard errors, confidence intervals, fit statistics, significance.
\item \strong{discovr_09}: Categorical predictors with two categories (comparing two means). Comparing two independent means, comparing two related means, effect sizes, robust comparisons of means (independent and related), Bayes factors and estimation (independent and related means).
\item \strong{discovr_10}: Moderation and mediation. Centring variables (grand mean centring), specifying interaction terms, moderation analysis, simple slopes analysis, Johnson-Neyman intervals, mediation with one predictor, direct and indirect effects, mediation using lavaan.
\item \strong{discovr_11}: Comparing several means. Essentially 'One-way independent ANOVA' but taught using a general linear model framework. Covers setting contrasts (dummy coding, contrast coding, and linear and quadratic trends), the \emph{F}-statistic and Welch's robust \emph{F}, robust parameter estimation, heteroscedasticity-consistent tests of parameters, robust tests of means based on trimmed data, \emph{post hoc} tests.
\item \strong{discovr_12}: Linear models involving continuous and categorical predictors. The example explores comparing means adjusted for other variables (a parallel slopes model or 'Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA)'). The tutorial covers setting contrasts, fitting the models, evaluating effects using \emph{F}-statistics based on Type III sums of squares and diagnostic plots, and interpretting the model using heteroscedasticity-consistent tests of parameters and \emph{post hoc} tests.
\item \strong{discovr_13}: Factorial designs. Fitting models for two-way factorial designs (independent measures) using lm(). This tutorial builds on previous ones to show how models can be fit with two categorical predictors to look at the interaction between them. We look at fitting the models, setting contrasts for the two categorical predictors, obtaining interaction plots, simple effects analysis, diagnostic plots and robust models.
\item \strong{discovr_13_afex}: Factorial designs. Fitting models for two-way factorial designs (independent measures) using the \code{afex} package. This tutorial takes an ANOVA approach to factorical designs. We look at fitting the models, interaction plots, simple effects analysis, diagnostic plots, partial omega-squared and robust models.
\item \strong{discovr_14}: Multilevel models. This tutorial looks at fitting multilevel models using the \code{glmmTMB} package (all code will also work with \code{lme4}). It begins with an optional section on checking and coding categorical variables before moving on to show you how to fit and interpret a multilevel model. We also look briefly at the \code{purrr} package.
\item \strong{discovr_14_lme}: Multilevel models. This tutorial looks at fitting multilevel models using the \code{nlme} package. It begins with an optional section on checking and coding categorical variables before moving on to show you how to fit and interpret a multilevel model.
\item \strong{discovr_15}: Repeated measures designs. Fitting models for one- and two-way repeated measures designs using the \code{afex} package. This tutorial builds on previous ones to show how models can be fit with one or two categorical predictors when these variables have been manipulated within the same entities. We look at fitting the models, setting contrasts for the categorical predictors, obtaining estimated marginal means, interaction plots, simple effects analysis, diagnostic plots, robust models and Bayes factors.
\item \strong{discovr_15_growth}: Modelling change over time. Growth models using multilevel modelling and the \code{glmmTMB} package. (All code will also work with \code{lme4}.) First we explore growth over time by building up a model to include a random intercept and slope for time. We then model non-linear change using both an exponential effect of time and a polynomials. We then extend the model to an example based on a clinical trial in which a fixed effect of an intervention moderates change over time.
\item \strong{discovr_16}: "Mixed designs. Fitting models for mixed designs using the \code{afex} package. This tutorial builds on previous ones to show how models can be fit with one or two categorical predictors when at least one of these variables has been manipulated within the same entities and at least one other has been manipulated using different entities. We look at fitting the models, setting contrasts for the categorical predictors, obtaining estimated marginal means, and interaction plots.
\item \strong{discovr_17}: Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA). Applying factor analysis using the \code{psych} package.
\item \strong{discovr_18}: Categorical variables. Entering categorical data, contingency tables, associations between categorical variables, the chi-square test, standardized residuals, Fisher's exact test.
\item \strong{discovr_19}: Categorical outcomes (logistic regression). This tutorial builds on previous ones to show how the general linear model model extends to situations where you want to predict a binary outcome (logistic regression). We look at fitting the models and interpreting the odds ratio.
\item \strong{discovr_bayes}: Bayesian taster tutorial. This tutorial offers a taster of Bayesian statistics by showing how to conduct various analyses from other tutorials within a Bayesian framework (mainly using default priors). We also look at Bayes factors".
}

\strong{Workflow}:

The tutorials are self-contained (you practice code in code boxes) so you don't need to use RStudio at the
same time. However, to get the most from them I would recommend that you create an RStudio project and within that open (and save) a new
R Markdown file each time to work through a tutorial. Within that Markdown file, replicate parts of the code from the tutorial (in code chunks)
and use Markdown to write notes about what you have done, and to reflect on things that you have struggled with, or note useful tips to help you
remember things. Basically, write a learning journal. This workflow has the advantage of not just teaching you the code that you need to do certain things,
but also provides practice in using RStudio itself.
