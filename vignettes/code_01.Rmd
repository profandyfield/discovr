## R markdown

### Basic text formatting

* Italic (\*): `Make text *italic* by placing it between asterisks (with no spaces)` will knit as: Make text *italic* by placing it between asterisks (with no spaces)
* Bold (\*\*): `Make text **bold** by placing it between asterisks (with no spaces)` will knit as:	Make text **bold** by placing it between asterisks (with no spaces)
* Superscript	(\^\^): `Make text^superscript^ by placing it between carats (with no spaces)` will knit as: Make text^superscript^ by placing it between asterisks (with no spaces)
* Subscript	(\~\~):	`Make text~subscript~ by placing it between tildes (with no spaces)` will knit as: Make text~subscript~ by placing it between tildes (with no spaces)
* Footnote [\^\1]: `A footnote[^1] and a second footnote[^2]` will knit as: A footnote[^1] and a second footnote[^2]

[^1]: Contents of my first footnote.
[^2]: Contents of my second footnote.

### Headings

You can use hashes to make headings of different levels. For example:
```
# Level 1 heading
## Level 2 heading
### Level 3 heading
#### Level 4 heading
##### Level 5 heading
###### Level 6 heading
```

will knit as:

# Level 1 heading
## Level 2 heading
### Level 3 heading
#### Level 4 heading
##### Level 5 heading
###### Level 6 heading


### Bullet lists

Single bullet lists, this:

```
* This is the first bullet
* This is the second
* This is the third
```
will knit as:

* This is the first bullet
* This is the second
* This is the third


Numbered bullet lists, this:

```
1. This is the first entry
2. This is the second
3. This is the third
```

will knit as:

1. This is the first entry
2. This is the second
3. This is the third

Complex lists. This:

```
* This is the first bullet point
    + this is a sub-bullet
    + so is this
* This is the second bullet
    + This is a sub-bullet
        - I've gone crazy and done a third level of bullets
        - It had to be done
* and this is the third
```

will knit as:

* This is the first bullet point
    + this is a sub-bullet
    + so is this
* This is the second bullet
    + This is a sub-bullet
        - I've gone crazy and done a third level of bullets
        - It had to be done
* and this is the third

### Hyperlinks

You use `[text do display](web address)` to insert hyperlinks. For example:

`My favourite band is [Iron Maiden](https://ironmaiden.com/)` will knit as:

My favourite band is [Iron Maiden](https://ironmaiden.com/)

### Images

You use `![Image caption (optional)](path to image)` to insert images. For example:

`![Figure 1: I love my spaniel](andy_milton.png)` knits as:

![Figure 1: I love my spaniel](andy_milton.png)

### Tables

Insert tables using raw text. | denotes a column and the colon position denotes the alignment of the column, for example `|---:|` is right justified, `|:---|` is left justified, and `|:---:|` is centred.

```
: My top 3 Iron Maiden albums

| Name                   | Year   | Cover rating | Favourite track |
|:-----------------------|:----:|------:|:--------------------------------:|
|Piece of mind           | 1983 | ****  | The Flight of Icarus             |
|The Number of the beast | 1982 | ****  | Children of the damned           |
|Powerslave              | 1984 | ***** | The rime of the ancient mariner  |
```

knits as:

: My top 3 Iron Maiden albums

| Name                     | Year   | Cover rating | Favourite track |
|:-------------------------|:------:|------:|:----------------------:|
|"Piece of mind"           | "1983" | "****"  | "The Flight of Icarus" |
|"The Number of the beast" | "1982" | "****"  | "Children of the damned" |
|"Powerslave"              | "1984" | "*****" | "The rime of the ancient mariner" |


Alternative, put your data in a tibble (more on this later) and use `knitr::kable()`:

```
tibble::tribble(
~Name, ~Year, ~`Cover rating`, ~`Favourite track`,
"Piece of mind", "1983",  "****", "The Flight of Icarus",
"The Number of the beast", "1982", "****", "Children of the damned",
"Powerslave", "1984", "*****", "The rime of the ancient mariner"
) %>% 
knitr::kable(caption = "My top 3 Iron Maiden albums")
```

will knit as:

```{r, results = 'asis'}
tibble::tribble(
~Name, ~Year, ~`Cover rating`, ~`Favourite track`,
"Piece of mind", "1983",  "****", "The Flight of Icarus",
"The Number of the beast", "1982", "****", "Children of the damned",
"Powerslave", "1984", "*****", "The rime of the ancient mariner"
) %>% 
knitr::kable(caption = "My top 3 Iron Maiden albums")
```


### Equations

You can include equations in R markdown using latex commands. You include an equation by enclosing it within `$$` (or a single `$` if you want the equation within the line of text you’re writing). To give you a flavour:

`We can include the linear model in a sentence like this: $Y_i = b_0 + b_1X_i + \epsilon_i$`

which will knit as:

We can include the linear model in a sentence like this: $Y_i = b_0 + b_1X_i + \epsilon_i$

Or, if we want it within its own paragraph we’d write it as this:
```
$$
Y_i = b_0 + b_1X_i + \epsilon_i
$$
```

which knits as:

$$
Y_i = b_0 + b_1X_i + \epsilon_i
$$


## Tidyverse and the pipe operator (%>%)

```{r}
# library(tidyverse) or library(magrittr) to access the pipe

core_members <- metallica %>% 
  subset(., metallica != "Rob") %>% 
  sort(.)

core_members
```


##	Getting data into R

```{r metallica}

name <- c("Lars Ulrich","James Hetfield", "Kirk Hammett", "Rob Trujillo", "Jason Newsted", "Cliff Burton", "Dave Mustaine")

# Numeric variables stored as double
songs_written <-  c(111, 112, 56, 16, 3, 11, 6)
net_worth <- c(300000000, 300000000, 200000000, 20000000, 40000000, 1000000, 20000000)

# Numeric variables stored as integer
songs_written_int <-  c(111L, 112L, 56L, 16L, 3L, 11L, 6L)
net_worth_int <- c(300000000L, 300000000L, 200000000L, 20000000L, 40000000L, 1000000L, 20000000L)

# Date variables
birth_date <- c("1963-12-26", "1963-08-03", "1962-11-18", "1964-10-23", "1963-03-04", "1962-02-10", "1961-09-13") %>% lubridate::ymd()

death_date <- c(NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, "1986-09-27", NA) %>% 
  lubridate::ymd()

# Logical variables
current_member <- c(TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE)

# Factor variables
instrument <- c(2, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0) %>% factor(levels = 0:2, labels = c("Guitar", "Bass", "Drums"))


instrument <- c("Drums", "Guitar", "Guitar", "Bass", "Bass", "Bass", "Guitar") %>%
  forcats::as_factor() %>%
  forcats::fct_relevel("Guitar", "Bass", "Drums")

levels(instrument)
levels(instrument) <- c("Proper guitar", "Bass guitar", "Drums") 

```


##	Tibbles and data frames 

###	Creating data frames 

```{r create_dat}
metalli_dat <- data.frame(name, birth_date, death_date, instrument, current_member, songs_written, net_worth)
```

###	Creating tibbles 
```{r create_tibble}
metalli_tib <- tibble(name, birth_date, death_date, instrument, current_member, songs_written, net_worth)
```

###	Viewing dataframes and tibbles 

```{r, view_tib}
metalli_tib

# View(metalli_tib) 
```


###	Creating an empty tibble 

```{r, emp_tib}

#to create an empty tibble called empty_tib that has 50 rows, execute:

empty_tib <- tibble(.rows = 10)

```


### Creating new variables within a tibble 

Using base R:

```{r}
metalli_tib$songs_written 
```

Using `dplyrr:mutate()`:

```{r}
metalli_tib <- metalli_tib %>% 
  dplyr::mutate(
    	albums = c(10, 10, 10, 2, 4, 3, 0)
  )

metalli_tib
```

You can create your data set by initializing an empty tibble and then using `dplyr::mutate` to add variables. For example, we can create `metalli_tib` from scratch as follows:

```{r}
metalli_tib <- tibble(.rows = 7) %>% 
  dplyr::mutate(
    name = c("Lars Ulrich","James Hetfield", "Kirk Hammett", "Rob Trujillo", "Jason Newsted", "Cliff Burton", "Dave Mustaine"),
    birth_date = c("1963-12-26", "1963-08-03", "1962-11-18", "1964-10-23", "1963-03-04", "1962-02-10", "1961-09-13") %>% lubridate::ymd(),
    death_date = c(NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, "1986-09-27", NA) %>% 
  lubridate::ymd(),
  instrument = c("Drums", "Guitar", "Guitar", "Bass", "Bass", "Bass", "Guitar") %>%
  forcats::as_factor() %>% forcats::fct_relevel("Guitar", "Bass", "Drums"),
  current_member = c(TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE),
  songs_written =  c(111, 112, 56, 16, 3, 11, 6),
net_worth = c(300000000, 300000000, 200000000, 20000000, 40000000, 1000000, 20000000)
  )
```

and now add one that quantifies how much they have earnt per they contributed to:

```{r}
metalli_tib <- metalli_tib %>% 
  dplyr::mutate(
    	worth_per_song = net_worth/songs_written
  )
metalli_tib
```

### Entering data directly into a tibble 

You can enter the data directly as a tibble (rather than creating an empty one and using `dplyr::mutate()`:

```{r}
metalli_tib <- tribble(
  ~name, ~birth_date, ~death_date, ~instrument, ~current_member, ~songs_written, ~net_worth,
  "Lars Ulrich", "1963-12-26", NA, "Drums", TRUE, 111, 300000000,
  "James Hetfield", "1963-08-03", NA, "Guitar", TRUE, 112, 300000000,
  "Kirk Hammett", "1962-11-18", NA, "Guitar", TRUE, 56, 200000000,
  "Rob Trujillo", "1964-10-23", NA, "Bass",  TRUE, 16, 20000000,
  "Jason Newsted", "1963-03-04", NA, "Bass", FALSE, 3, 40000000,
  "Cliff Burton", "1962-02-10", "1986-09-27", "Bass", FALSE, 11, 1000000,
  "Dave Mustaine", "1961-09-13", NA, "Guitar", FALSE, 6, 20000000
  ) %>% 
  dplyr::mutate(
    birth_date = lubridate::ymd(birth_date),
    death_date = lubridate::ymd(death_date)
  )


```


### Finding a cell of a data frame or tibble 

Three ways to discover which instrument Lars Ulrich 'plays':

```{r}
metalli_tib[1, 4]
metalli_tib[1, "instrument"]
metalli_tib[name == "Lars Ulrich", "instrument"]
```

### Selecting variables

Using base R

```{r}
# These commands return the contents of the variable called 'name'
metalli_tib$name
metalli_tib[1]
metalli_tib["name"]

# Both of these commands return the contents of the variables called 'name' and instrument
metalli_tib[c(1, 4)]
metalli_tib[c("name", "instrument")]
```

The tidyverse way

```{r}
metalli_tib %>% 
  dplyr::select(name, instrument)
```

You can exclude variables too, try these out:

```{r}
metalli_tib %>% 
  dplyr::select(-name)

metalli_tib %>% 
  dplyr::select(-c(name, instrument))
```

You can save a subsetted tibble to a new object:

```{r}
# Save a version of metalli_tib but exclude the variable called name

metalli_anon_tib <- metalli_tib %>% 
  dplyr::select(-name)

#View this new object
metalli_anon_tib
```

### Selecting cases (filtering tibbles)

Using base R we can do the following. View only the data for the current members of metallica:

```{r}
metalli_tib[current_member == TRUE,]
```

View only the instruments played by the current members of metallica:

```{r}
metalli_tib[current_member == TRUE, "instrument"]
```

View only the names, instruments played, and number of songs written by the current members of metallica:

```{r}
metalli_tib[current_member == TRUE, c("name", "instrument", "songs_written")]
```

```{r}
metalli_tib[songs_written > 50,]
```

Using `dplyr::filter()`

```{r}
dplyr::filter(metalli_tib, current_member == TRUE)

# Or using a pipe:

metalli_tib %>% 
  dplyr::filter(current_member == TRUE)
```

Again, we can save the filtered tibble to a new object:

```{r}
metallica_current <- metalli_tib %>% 
  dplyr::filter(current_member == TRUE)

metallica_current
```

Combining conditions:

```{r}
metalli_tib %>% 
  dplyr::filter(is.na(death_date) & instrument == "Bass guitar")
```

If we change `is.na()` to `!is.na()` we get Cliff Burton's data (the only member who is a bassist and does NOT have a value of 'NA' for the variable death_date):

```{r}
metalli_tib %>% 
  dplyr::filter(!is.na(death_date) & instrument == "Bass guitar")
```

We can also use the OR operator (|) to set conditions for which only one has to be true. For example, to select members who are either bassists OR drummers we'd use:

```{r}
metalli_tib %>% 
  dplyr::filter(instrument == "Drums" | instrument == "Bass guitar")
```

### Combining selecting cases with selecting variables 

This command filters `metalli_tib` according to whether the variable `current_member` is equal to TRUE and whether the variable `instrument` is NOT equal to (`!=`) the phrase "Bass guitar":

```{r}
metalli_worth  <- metalli_tib %>% 
  dplyr::filter(current_member == TRUE & instrument != "Bass guitar")

metalli_worth
```

Having done this, we could pass the object `net_worth` object that we just created into the `select` function to select the variables `name` and `net_worth`:

```{r}
metalli_worth  <- metalli_worth  %>% 
  dplyr::select(name, net_worth)

metalli_worth
```

Better still, combine the two operations into a single pipe:

```{r}
metalli_worth <- metalli_tib %>% 
  dplyr::filter(current_member == TRUE & instrument != "Bass guitar") %>% 
  dplyr::select(name, net_worth)

metalli_worth
```

Doing the same with base R will make your eyes hurt

```{r}
metalli_worth <- metalli_tib[current_member == TRUE & instrument != "Bass guitar", c("name", "net_worth")]
metalli_worth
```

### Exporting data

```{r}
readr::write_csv(metalli_tib, "../data/metallica.csv")

# or 

readr::write_csv(metalli_tib, here::here("/data/metallica.csv"))
```

##	Using other software to get data in R


```{r, eval = FALSE}
metalli_tib <- readr::read_csv("../data/metallica.csv")

# or 

metalli_tib <- here::here("/data/metallica.csv") %>% readr::read_csv()
```

We can specify data types:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
metalli_tib <- readr::read_csv("../data/metallica.csv", col_types = cols(
  name = col_character(),
  birth_date = col_date(),
  death_date = col_date(),
  instrument = col_factor(),
  current_member = col_logical(),
  songs_written = col_double(),
  net_worth = col_double()
  )
)

#OR

metalli_tib <- readr::read_csv("../data/metallica.csv", col_types = "cDDfldd")

# OR

metalli_tib <- readr::read_csv("../data/metallica.csv") %>% 
  dplyr::mutate(
    instrument = forcats::as_factor(instrument)
  )

metalli_tib$instrument

```
