```{r, eval = F, echo = F}
# Create bib file for R packages

tidylist <- c('forcats', 'lubridate', 'readr')
otherlist <- c('here')

here::here("inst/tutorials/discovr_01/packages.bib") |>
  knitr::write_bib(c(easylist, tidylist, otherlist), file = _)
```

In this tutorial all packages are pre-loaded. If working outside of the tutorial, load the `tidyverse` package at the beginning of your `r quarto()` document:

```{r eval = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

This tutorial uses the following packages:

- `here` [@R-here]

It also uses these packages from `tidyverse`
 
- `forcats` [@R-forcats]
- `lubridate` [@R-lubridate]
- `readr` [@R-readr]
