#' AC/DC are one one of the best-selling hard rock bands in history, with around 100 million certified sales, and an estimated 200 million actual sales.
#' In 1980 their original singer Bon Scott died of alcohol poisoning and choking on his own vomit. He was replaced by Brian Johnson who has been their singer ever since.
#' Debate rages with unerring frequency within the rock music press over who is the better frontman. The conventional wisdom is that Bon Scott was better although personally, and I seem to be somewhat in the minority here, I prefer Brian Johnson.
#' Anyway, Robert Oxoby in a playfull paper decided to put this argument to bed once and for all (Oxoby, 2008).
#' Using a task from experimental economics called the ultimatum game, individuals are assigned the role of either proposer or responder and paired randomly.
#' Proposers are allocated $10 from which they have to make a financial offer to the responder (i.e., $2). The responder can accept or reject this offer. If the offer is rejected neither party gets any money,
#' but if the offer is accepted the responder keeps the offered amount (e.g., $2), and the proposer keeps the original amount minus what they offered (e.g., $8). For half of the participants the song
#' 'It's a long way to the top' sung by Bon Scott was playing in the background, for the remainder 'Shoot to thrill' sung by Brian Johnson was playing. Oxoby measured the offers made by proposers,
#' and the minimum offers that responders accepted (called the minimum acceptable offer). He reasoned that people would accept lower offers and propose higher offers when listening to something they like
#' (because of the 'feel-good factor' the music creates). Therefore, by comparing the value of offers made and the minimum acceptable offers in the two groups he could see whether people have more of a feel
#' good factor when listening to Bon or Brian. There were 18 people per group.
#'
#' These data are approximated from graphs within Oxoby (2008). The object contains the following variables:
#'
#'   * **singer**: the type of teaching method used
#'   * **offer**: offer made (in dollars)

#' Alien scents

#'
#' The aliens, excited by humans' apparent inability to train sniffer dogs to detect them (see [sniffer_dogs]), decided to move their invasion plan forward.
#' Aliens are far too wedded to *p*-values in small samples. They decided that they could make themselves even
#' harder to detect by fooling the sniffer dogs by masking their alien smell. After extensive research they agreed
#' that the two most effective masking scents would be human pheromones (which they hoped would make them smell human-like)
#' and fox-pheromones (because they are a powerful, distracting smell for dogs). The aliens started smearing themselves with humans
#' and foxes and prepared to invade.
#' Meanwhile, the top-secret government agency for Training Extra-terrestrial Reptile Detection (TERD) had got wind of their plan and set about testing how effective it would be.
#' They trained 50 sniffer dogs. During training, these dogs were rewarded for making vocalizations while sniffing alien space lizards.
#' On the test trials, the 50 dogs were allowed to sniff 9 different entities for 1-minute each: 3 alien space lizards, 3 shapeshifting alien space
#' lizard who had taken on humanoid form, and 3 humans. Within each type of entity, 1 had no masking scent, 1 was smothered in human pheromones and 1 wore fox pheromones.

#' after being caught having sex with it. I'm not sure he treated the goat to a nice dinner in a posh restaurant before taking advantage of her, but either way you have to feel sorry for the goat.
#' I'd barely had time to recover from that story when another appeared about an Indian man forced to marry a dog to atone for stoning two dogs and stringing them up in a tree 15 years earlier.
#' Why anyone would think it's a good idea to enter a dog into matrimony with a man with a history of violent behaviour towards dogs is beyond me.
#' Still, I wondered whether a goat or dog made a better spouse. I found (but not really) some other people who had been forced to marry goats and dogs and measured their life satisfaction and, also, how much they like animals.

#' Beckham (1929) data
#'
#' A dataset from Field, A. P. (2026). Discovering statistics using R and RStudio (2nd ed.). London: Sage.
#'
#' During my psychology degree I spent a lot of time reading about the civil rights movement in the USA. Instead of reading psychology,
#' I read about Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Jr. For this reason I find Beckham's 1929 study of black Americans
#' a fascinating historical piece of research. Beckham was a black American who founded the psychology laboratory
#' at Howard University, Washington, DC and his wife Ruth was the first black woman ever to be awarded a PhD
#' (also in psychology) at the University of Minnesota. To put some context on the study, it was published
#' 36 years before the Jim Crow laws were finally overthrown by the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and in a time when
#' black Americans were segregated, openly discriminated against and victims of the most abominable violations of
#' civil liberties and human rights (I recommend James Baldwin's superb The fire next time for an insight into the times).
#' The language of the study and the data from it are an uncomfortable reminder of the era in which it was conducted.
#'
#' Beckham sought to measure the psychological state of 3443 black Americans with three questions. He asked them to
#' answer yes or no to whether they thought black Americans were happy, whether they personally were happy as a black
#' American, and whether black Americans should be happy. Beckham did no formal statistical analysis of his data
#' (Fisher's article containing the popularized version of the chi-square test was published only 7 years earlier
#' in a statistics journal that would not have been read by psychologists).
#' I love this study, because it demonstrates that you do not need elaborate methods to answer important and far-reaching questions;
#' with just three questions, Beckham told the world an enormous amount about very real and important psychological and sociological phenomena.
#' These are the data from that study. The data contains the following variables:
#'
#'
#'   * **profession**: Profession of respondents
#'   * **response**: response to the question as yes or no
#'   * **happy**: frequencies of reponses to a question about whether black Americans were happy
#'   * **you_happy**: frequencies of reponses to a question about whether they personally were happy
#'   * **should_be_happy**: frequencies of reponses to a question about whether black Americans should be happy

#' Bronstein et al. (2019) data
#'
#' A dataset from Field, A. P. (2026). Discovering statistics using R and RStudio (2nd ed.). London: Sage.
#'
#'  The rapid increase in 'fake news' and misinformation is a worrying trend in recent years.
#'  Perhaps more worrying is how widely some of this news is taken as fact. Researchers have started to look at what
#'  characteristics predict susceptibility to fake news. Bronstein et al. (2019) hypothesised that delusion-prone individuals
#'  may be more likely to believe fake news because of their tendency to engage in less analytic and open-minded thinking.
#'  They conducted two online studies that got merged into a single analysis to test this hypothesis. This object is a subset of variables from
#'  their data (I have changed the variable names to match the constructs measured rather than the scales used to measure them).
#'  The full dataset is available at \doi{10.1016/j.jarmac.2018.09.005}.
#'
#'   * **id** (ResponseID in the original dataset): participant ID
#'   * **fake_newz** (ZBelief_Fake in the original dataset): participants viewed 12 fake news headlines, each with a brief description and photo, and rated their accuracy (1 = Not at all accurate, 4 = Very accurate). This variable is the average rating converted to a z-score.
#'   * **delusionz** (ZPDI_Total in the original dataset): Peter's et al Delusion Inventory (PDI), which uses statements such as “Do you ever feel as if there is a conspiracy against you?” to gauge a person's propensity for delusion-like thinking. Again, scores were converted to z-scores.
#'   * **thinkz_open** (ZAOT_Total in the original dataset):  open minded thinking was assessed with the Actively Open-minded Thinking (AOT) scale, on which people endorse statements such as “A person should always consider new possibilities” using a six-point scale (1 = strongly disagree, 6 = strongly agree). The total score was again converted to z.
#'   * **thinkz_anal** (ZRF_Total in the original dataset): Analytic thinking was assessed using the Cognitive Reflection Test (CRT), which uses several problems that have intuitive-but-incorrect responses. Participants must override their intuition to get the correct answer. Over 7 items, higher scores (converted to z-scores again) indicate a greater tendency to use an analytic cognitive style.

#'
#' A dataset from Field, A. P. (2026). Discovering statistics using R and RStudio (2nd ed.). London: Sage.
#'
#' Some quail develop fetishes. Really. In studies where a terrycloth object acts as a sign that a mate will shortly
#' become available, some quail start to direct their sexuial behaviour towards the terrycloth object.
#' In evolutionary terms, this fetishistic behaviour seems counterproductive because sexual behaviour becomes directed
#' towards something that cannot provide reproductive success. However, perhaps this behaviour serves to prepare the
#' organism for the 'real' mating behaviour.
#'
#' Cetinkaya and Domjan (2006) sexually conditioned male quail.
#' All quail experienced the terrycloth stimulus and an opportunity to mate, but for some the terrycloth stimulus
#' immediately preceded the mating opportunity (paired group) whereas others experienced a 2-hour delay
#' (this acted as a control group because the terrycloth stimulus did not predict a mating opportunity).
#' In the paired group, quail were classified as fetishistic or not depending on whether they engaged in sexual
#' behaviour with the terrycloth object.
#'
#' During a test trial the quail mated with a female and the researchers measured the percentage of eggs fertilized,
#' the time spent near the terrycloth object, the latency to initiate copulation, and copulatory efficiency.
#' If this fetishistic behaviour provides an evolutionary advantage then we would expect the fetishistic quail to
#' fertilize more eggs, initiate copulation faster and be more efficient in their copulations.

#' There is some evidence that students tend to pick courses of lecturers they perceive to be enthusastic and good communicators.
#' In a fascinating study, Tomas Chamorro-Premuzic and his colleagues (Chamorro-Premuzic, Furnham, Christopher, Garwood, & Martin, 2008)
#' tested the hypothesis that students tend to like lecturers who are like themselves. The authors measured students' own personalities
#' using a very well-established measure (the NEO-FFI) which measures five fundamental personality traits: neuroticism, extroversion,
#' openness to experience, agreeableness and conscientiousness. Students also completed a questionnaire in which they were given descriptions
#' (e.g., 'warm: friendly, warm, sociable, cheerful, affectionate, outgoing') and asked to rate how much they wanted to see this in a lecturer
#' from -5 (I don't want this characteristic at all) through 0 (the characteristic is not important) to +5 (I really want this characteristic in my lecturer).
#' The characteristics were the same as those measured by the NEO-FFI. As such, the authors had a measure of how much a student had each of the
#' five core personality characteristics, but also a measure of how much they wanted to see those same characteristics in their lecturer.

#'   Many of us have experienced that feeling after we have left the house of wondering whether we remembered to lock the door,
#'   close the window, or remove the bodies from the fridge in case the police turn up. However,
#'   some people with obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) check things so excessively that they might, for example,
#'   take hours to leave the house. One theory is that this checking behaviour is caused by the mood you
#'   are in (positive or negative) interacting with the rules you use to decide when to stop a task
#'   (do you continue until you feel like stopping, or until you have done the task as best as you can?).

#'   to think of as many things as they could that they should check before going on holiday (**checks**)

#' A dataset containing the song features data from the [Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/) for the studio albums (190-2015) of the greatest band ever, [Iron Maiden](https://www.ironmaiden.com).
#' Data were obtained using the [spotifyr](https://www.rcharlie.com/spotifyr/) package.
#'
#' * **artist_name**: Pointless variable that reminds us that the data relate to Iron Maiden
#' * **album_name**: Name of the album
#' * **track_name**: Name of the song
#' * **year**: Year of release of the album
#' * **danceability**: From the Spotify API: "Danceability describes how suitable a track is for dancing based on a combination of musical elements including tempo, rhythm stability, beat strength, and overall regularity. A value of 0.0 is least danceable and 1.0 is most danceable."
#' * **energy**: From the Spotify API: "Energy is a measure from 0.0 to 1.0 and represents a perceptual measure of intensity and activity. Typically, energetic tracks feel fast, loud, and noisy. For example, death metal has high energy, while a Bach prelude scores low on the scale. Perceptual features contributing to this attribute include dynamic range, perceived loudness, timbre, onset rate, and general entropy."
#' * **key**: From the Spotify API: "The key the track is in. Integers map to pitches using standard Pitch Class notation . E.g. 0 = C, 1 = C-sharp/D-flat, 2 = D, and so on."
#' * **loudness**: From the Spotify API: "The overall loudness of a track in decibels (dB). Loudness values are averaged across the entire track and are useful for comparing relative loudness of tracks. Loudness is the quality of a sound that is the primary psychological correlate of physical strength (amplitude). Values typical range between -60 and 0 db."
#' * **mode**: From the Spotify API: "Mode indicates the modality (major or minor) of a track, the type of scale from which its melodic content is derived. Major is represented by 1 and minor is 0."
#' * **speechiness**: From the Spotify API: "Speechiness detects the presence of spoken words in a track. The more exclusively speech-like the recording (e.g. talk show, audio book, poetry), the closer to 1.0 the attribute value. Values above 0.66 describe tracks that are probably made entirely of spoken words. Values between 0.33 and 0.66 describe tracks that may contain both music and speech, either in sections or layered, including such cases as rap music. Values below 0.33 most likely represent music and other non-speech-like tracks."
#' * **acousticness**: From the Spotify API: "A confidence measure from 0.0 to 1.0 of whether the track is acoustic. 1.0 represents high confidence the track is acoustic."
#' * **instrumentalness**: From the Spotify API: "Predicts whether a track contains no vocals. “Ooh” and “aah” sounds are treated as instrumental in this context. Rap or spoken word tracks are clearly “vocal”. The closer the instrumentalness value is to 1.0, the greater likelihood the track contains no vocal content. Values above 0.5 are intended to represent instrumental tracks, but confidence is higher as the value approaches 1.0."
#' * **liveness**: From the Spotify API: "Detects the presence of an audience in the recording. Higher liveness values represent an increased probability that the track was performed live. A value above 0.8 provides strong likelihood that the track is live."
#' * **valence**: From the Spotify API: "A measure from 0.0 to 1.0 describing the musical positiveness conveyed by a track. Tracks with high valence sound more positive (e.g. happy, cheerful, euphoric), while tracks with low valence sound more negative (e.g. sad, depressed, angry)."
#' * **tempo**: From the Spotify API: "The overall estimated tempo of a track in beats per minute (BPM). In musical terminology, tempo is the speed or pace of a given piece and derives directly from the average beat duration."
#' * **time_signature**: From the Spotify API: "An estimated overall time signature of a track. The time signature (meter) is a notational convention to specify how many beats are in each bar (or measure)."
#' * **duration_ms**: Song length in milliseconds as an integer value.

#' In my teens I was in a band called Andromeda. I sang, we had a guitarist called Malcolm. We learnt several Queen and Iron Maiden songs and we were truly awful. Suffice it to say, you'd be hard pushed to recognize which Iron Maiden and Queen songs we were trying to play. It's common for bands to tire of cover versions and to get lofty ambitions to write their own tunes. I wrote one called 'Escape From Inside' about the film The Fly that contained the rhyming couplet of 'I am a fly, I want to die' – the great lyricists of the time quaked in their boots at the young new talent on the scene. The only thing we did that resembled the activities of a 'proper' band was to split up due to 'musical differences': Malcolm wanted to write 15-part symphonies about a boy's journey to worship electricity pylons, whereas I wanted to write songs about flies and dying (preferably both). When we could not agree on a musical direction the split became inevitable. Had I had the power of statistics in my hands back then, rather than split up we could have tested empirically the best musical direction for the band. This study imagines such a world. A study was conducted to see whether I wrote better songs than my old bandmate Malcolm, and whether this depended on the type of song (a symphony or song about flies). The outcome variable was the number of screams elicited by audience members during the songs.

#'
#' It's something of a wonder how evolution managed to produce such a monstrosity as the human penis.
#' One theory is sperm competition: the human penis has an unusually large glans (the 'bell-end') compared to other primates,
#' and this may have evolved so that the penis can displace seminal fluid from other males by 'scooping it out' during intercourse.
#' Armed with various devices from Hollywood Exotic Novelties, an artificial vagina from California Exotic Novelties, and some water and cornstarch
#' Gallup et al. (2003) put this theory to the test. They loaded the artificial vagina with 2.6 ml of fake sperm and inserted one
#' of three female sex toys into it before withdrawing it: a control phallus that had no coronal ridge (i.e., no bell-end),
#' a phallus with a minimal coronal ridge (small bell-end) and a phallus with a coronal ridge. They measured sperm displacement as a percentage:
#' 100% means that all the sperm was displaced, and 0% means that none of the sperm was displaced. If the human penis evolved as a sperm displacement
#' device then Gallup et al. predicted: (1) that having a bell-end would displace more sperm than not; and
#' (2) that the phallus with the larger coronal ridge would displace more sperm than the phallus with the minimal coronal ridge. The data from the study has three variables:
#'
#' * **id**: The participant's id (these do not come from the study data file)

#' Apparently there are more beautiful women in the world than there are handsome men. Satoshi Kanazawa explains this finding
#' in terms of good-looking parents being more likely to have a baby daughter as their first child than a baby son.
#' Perhaps more controversially, he suggests that, from an evolutionarily perspective, beauty is a more valuable trait for women than
#' for men (Kanazawa, 2007). In a playful and very informative paper, Andrew Gelman and David Weakliem discuss various
#' statistical errors and misunderstandings, some of which have implications for Kanazawa's claims.
#' The 'playful' part of the paper is that to illustrate their point they collected data on the 50 most beautiful celebrities
#' (as listed by People magazine) of 1995-2000. They counted how many male and female children they had as of 2007.
#' If Kanazawa is correct, these beautiful people would have produced more girls than boys.

#' Everyone likes a good gossip from time to time, but apparently it has an evolutionary function.
#' One school of thought is that gossip is used as a way to derogate sexual competitors – especially
#' by questioning their appearance and sexual behaviour. Apparently men rate gossiped-about women as
#' less attractive, and they are more influenced by the gossip if it came from a woman with a high mate value
#' (i.e. attractive and sexually desirable). Karlijn Massar and her colleagues hypothesized that if this theory
#' is true then (1) younger women will gossip more because there is more mate competation at younger ages; and
#' (2) this relationship will be mediated by the mate value of the person (because for those with high mate value
#' gossiping for the purpose of sexual competition will be more effective). These are the data from that study.
#'
#' Eighty-three women aged from 20 to 50 (age) completed questionnaire measures of their tendency to gossip (gossip) and their sexual desirability (mate_value). Lambert et al. (2012) found that pornography is related to infidelity. This object contains the data from that study.

This score is the average response across the 16 items.

#' their choice was correct. Half of the children were always told that the negative interpretation was correct,
#' and the reminder were told that the positive interpretation was correct.

#' (\emph{never}, \emph{rarely}, \emph{sometimes}, \emph{frequently}, \emph{always}). The authors dropped two items because they had low means and variances,
#' and dropped three others because of relatively low correlations with other items. They performed a principal component analysis on the remaining 31 items (\emph{N} = 207).

#' Penalty kicks data
#'
#' A dataset from Field, A. P. (2026). Discovering statistics using R and RStudio (2nd ed.). London: Sage.
#'
#'  Fictional data set looking at predictors of success of penalty takers in soccer (or whatever sport you enjoy).
#'  Imagine we wanted to research the factors that affect penalty-taking success. In soccer, games in knockout competitions
#'  are sometimes decided by a penalty shootout. The format is that each team takes five penalties using five different players.
#'  inning team is the one that scores the most goals from the five penalties. If after this initial stage both teams have
#'   the same number of goals it goes to an excitingly named 'sudden death'. Fortunately no one suddenly dies,
#'   but instead each team takes a penalty and if both score or both miss another penalty is taken, but if one team
#'   scores and the other misses the scoring team wins the game. As you might imagine, the pressure ramps up considerably
#'   with each successive penalty. If the first player misses his or her kick, then it's not necessarily a disaster
#'   because there are four more kicks to be taken, and (most important) opportunities for your opponent to miss or to make up for your mistake.
#'   However, if you are the player taking the fifth penalty you are under a lot more pressure because a miss is highly likely to result in your team losing.
#'   The pressure ramps up, the more penalties are taken. A sports scientist wanted to look at whether the position in the penalty shootout did predict success in a shootout.
#'   She collated data from penalty shootouts across various worldwide men's and women's soccer leagues as well as getting coaches'
#'   ratings of players. The outcome variable is whether a penalty is scored or missed.
#'
#'   The data contain the following variables:
#'
#' * **id**: Penalty taker's id
#' * **ability**: Each player was rated against all other players the coaches had coached using a scale from 1 to 10, where 1 is 'their penalties are in the bottom 10% of players I've coached', 2 is 'their penalties are in the bottom 10–20% of players I've coached', and 10 is 'their penalties are in the top 10% of players I've coached'.
#' * **position**: position in the shootout (1 = first penalty, 5 = fifth penalty).

#'
#' Despite the increase in puppies on my campus (which can only be a good thing) to reduce stress,
#' the evidence base is pretty mixed. Imagine we wanted to contribute to this literature by running a
#' study in which we randomized people into three groups (dose): (1) a control group, which could be
#' a treatment as usual, a no treatment (no puppies) or ideally some kind of placebo group (we could
#' give people in this group a cat disguised as a dog); (2) 15 minutes of puppy therapy (a low-dose
#' group); and (3) 30 minutes of puppy contact (a high-dose group). The dependent variable was a
#' measure of happiness ranging from 0 (as unhappy as I can possibly imagine) to 10 (as happy as I can
#' possibly imagine). The design of this study mimics a very simple randomized controlled trial (as used
#' in pharmacological, medical and psychological intervention trials) because people are randomized into

#' measure a trait that I termed 'R anxiety'. I devised a questionnaire to measure various aspects of students'
#' anxiety towards learning R, the RAQ. I generated (in my imagination) questions based on interviews (that never happened in real life)
#'  with anxious and non-anxious students and came up with 23 possible questions to include. Each question was a statement
#'  followed by a five-point Likert scale: \emph{strongly disagree} = 1, \emph{disagree}, \emph{neither agree nor disagree}, \emph{agree} and \emph{strongly agree} (SD, D, N, A and SA respectively).
#'  What's more, I wanted to know whether anxiety about R could be broken down into specific forms of anxiety. In other words,
#'  what latent variables contribute to anxiety about R?

#' Let's begin with a Christmas tale. A year ago Santa was resting in his workshop studying his nice
#' and naughty lists. He noticed a name on the naughty list in bold, upper case letters.
#' It said **ANDY FIELD OF UNIVERSITY OF SUSSEX**. He went to look up the file of this Andy Field
#' character. He stared into his snow globe, and as the mists cleared he saw a sad, lonely,
#' friend-less character walking across campus. Under one arm a box of chocolates, under
#' the other a small pink Hippo. As he walked the campus he enticed the young students
#' around him to follow him by offering chocolate. Like the Pied Piper, he led them to
#' a large hall. Once inside, the boys and girls' eyes glistened in anticipation of
#' more chocolate. Instead he unleashed a monologue about the general linear model of
#' such fearsome tedium that Santa began to wonder how anyone could have grown to be
#' so soulless and cruel.
#'
#' Santa dusted off his sleigh and whizzed through the night sky to the Sussex campus.
#' Once there he confronted the evil fiend that he had seen in his globe. "You've been
#' a naughty boy," he said. "I give you a choice. Give up teaching statistics, or
#' I will be forced to let the [Krampus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krampus) pay
#' you a visit."
#'
#' Andy looked sad, "But I love statistics," he said to Santa, "It's cool."
#'
#' Santa pulled out a candy cane, from it emerged a screen. Just as he was about to instruct
#' the screen to call the Krampus, an incoming message appeared: some presents had not been delivered last Christmas!
#'
#' What was Santa to do? How could he find out what determines whether presents get delivered or not? He panicked.
#'
#' Just then, Santa heard a sad little voice. It said, "I can help you".
#'
#' "How? replied Santa.
#'
#' "My students," he replied, "they can save Christmas. All they need are some data."
#'
#' With that, Santa looked into his candy screen at the elves who had called him, and turned to Andy. "Tell them what you need."
#'
#' Andy discovered that to deliver presents Santa uses a large team of elves, and that at each house
#' they usually consume treats. The treats might be Christmas pudding, or sometimes
#' mulled wine. He also discovered that they consume different quantities.
#' Sometimes nothing is left, but other times there might be 1, 2, 3 or even 4

#' When the alien invasion comes we'll need spaniels (or possibly other dogs, but lets hope its mainly spaniels because spaniels are cool)
#' to help us to identify the space lizards. The top-secret government agency for Training Extra-terrestrial Reptile Detection (TERD) was put together
#' to test the plausibility of training sniffer dogs to detect aliens. Over many trials 8 of their best dogs (Milton, Woofy, Ramsey, Mr. Snifficus III,
#' Willock, The Venerable Dr. Waggy, Lord Scenticle, and Professor Nose) were recruited for a pilot study. During training, these dogs were rewarded
#' for making vocalizations while sniffing alien space lizards (which they happened to have a few of in Hangar 18).
#' On the test trial, the 8 dogs were allowed to sniff 4 entities for 1-minute each: an alien space lizard, a shapeshifting alien space
#' lizard who had taken on humanoid form and worked undetected as a statistics lecturer, a human, and a human mannequin). The number of vocalizations made

#' Social anxiety data
#'
#' A dataset from Field, A. P. (2026). Discovering statistics using R and RStudio (2nd ed.). London: Sage.
#'
#' Anxiety disorders take on different shapes and forms, and each disorder is believed to be distinct and have unique causes.
#' We can summarize the disorders and some popular theories as follows:
#'
#' * Social Anxiety: Social anxiety disorder is a marked and persistent fear of 1 or more social or performance situations in which the person is exposed to unfamiliar people or possible scrutiny by others. This anxiety leads to avoidance of these situations. People with social phobia are believed to feel elevated feelings of shame.
#' * Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD): OCD is characterized by the everyday intrusion into conscious thinking of intense, repetitive, personally abhorrent, absurd and alien thoughts (Obsessions), leading to the endless repetition of specific acts or to the rehearsal of bizarre and irrational mental and behavioural rituals (compulsions).
#'
#' Social anxiety and obsessive compulsive disorder are seen as distinct disorders having different causes. However, there are some similarities.
#' They both involve some kind of attentional bias: attention to bodily sensation in social anxiety and attention to things that could have negative consequences in OCD.
#' They both involve repetitive thinking styles: social phobics ruminate about social encounters after the event (known as post-event processing), and people with OCD
#' have recurring intrusive thoughts and images. They both involve safety behaviours (i.e. trying to avoid the thing that makes you anxious).
#'
#' This might lead us to think that, rather than being different disorders, they are manifestations of the same core processes (Field & Cartwright-Hatton, 2008). One way to research
#' this possibility would be to see whether social anxiety can be predicted from measures of other anxiety disorders. If social anxiety disorder and OCD are distinct we should expect
#' that measures of OCD will not predict social anxiety. However, if there are core processes underlying all anxiety disorders, then measures of OCD should predict social anxiety.
#' The data contains three variables:
#'
#'   * **spai**: The Social Phobia and Anxiety Inventory (SPAI), which measures levels of social anxiety.
#'   * **iii**: The Interpretation of Intrusions Inventory (III).
#'   * **obq**: Obsessive Beliefs Questionnaire (OBQ), which measures the degree to which people experience obsessive beliefs like those found in OCD.
#'   * **tosca**: The Test of Self-Conscious Affect (TOSCA), which measures shame.

#' Soya and sperm counts data
#'
#' A dataset from Field, A. P. (2026). Discovering statistics using R and RStudio (2nd ed.). London: Sage.
#'
#' I read a story in a newspaper (yes, back when they existed) claiming that the chemical genistein, which is
#' naturally occurring in soya, was linked to lowered sperm counts in Western males. When you read the actual study,
#' it had been conducted on rats, it found no link to lowered sperm counts, but there was evidence of abnormal sexual
#' development in male rats (probably because genistein acts like oestrogen). As journalists tend to do, a study showing no
#' link between soya and sperm counts was used as the scientific basis for an article about soya being the cause of declining
#' sperm counts in Western males. Imagine the rat study was enough for us to want to test this idea in humans.
#' We recruit 80 males and split them into four groups that vary in the number of soya 'meals' (a dinner containing 75g of soya)
#' they ate per week over a year: no soya meals (i.e., none in the whole year), one per week (52 over the year),
#' four per week (208 over the year), and seven per week (364 over the year). At the end of the year, participants
#' produced some sperm that I could count (when I say 'I', I mean someone else in a laboratory as far away from me as humanly possible).
#' The fictitious data contain the following variables:

#' Speed dating data
#'
#' A dataset from Field, A. P. (2026). Discovering statistics using R and RStudio (2nd ed.). London: Sage.
#'
#'  Imagine a scientist designed a study to look at the interplay between looks, personality and
#'  dating strategies on evaluations of a date. She set up a speed-dating night with 9 tables at which there
#'  sat a 'date'. All the dates were stooges selected to vary in their attractiveness (high, average and low),
#'  their personality (high charisma, average charisma, writes statistics books), and also the strategy
#'  they were told to employ during the conversation (normal or playing hard to get).
#'  The dates were trained before the study to act charismatically to varying degrees, and also how to act
#'  in a way that made them seem unobtainable (hard to get) or not. As such, across the nine dates/stooges
#'  there were three 'high attractive' people one of whom acted charismatically, one who acted normally (average) and
#'  another who acted with low charisma, likewise for the three average looking dates and the three low attractiveness dates.
#'  Therefore, each participant attending a speed-dating night would be exposed to all combinations of attractiveness and charisma
#'  (these are repeated measures).
#'
#'  Upon arrival participants were randomly assigned a blue or red sticker.
#'  For the participants with the red sticker the stooges played hard to get (unobtainable) and for
#'  those with a blue sticker they acted normally. Over the course a few nights 20 people attended,
#'  spent 5-minutes with each of the 9 'dates' and then rated how much they'd like to have a proper date with the person
#'  as a percentage (100% = 'I'd pay large sums of money for their phone number', 0% = 'I'd pay a large sum of money for a plane
#'  ticket to get me as far away from them as possible'). The (fictional) data contains the following variables:

#' someone a bit more interesting to stalk, but apparently times were hard. It could have been a lot worse,

#' different groups of stalkers (25 stalkers in each treatment). To the first group he gave cruel-to-be-kind therapy
#' (every time the stalkers followed him around, or sent him a letter, the psychologist attacked them with a cattle prod).
#' The second therapy was psychodyshamic therapy, in which stalkers were hypnotized and regressed into their childhood
#' to discuss their penis (or lack of penis), their father's penis, their dog's penis, the seventh penis of a seventh penis,
#' and any other penis that sprang to mind. The psychologist measured the number of hours stalking in one week both before

#'
#' Visceral factors that require us to engage in self control (such as a filling bladder) can affect our inhibtory
#' abilities in unrelated domains. In a fascinating study by Tuk, Trampe, and Warlop (2011) participants were given
#' five cups of water: one group was asked to drink them all, whereas another was asked to take a sip from each.
#' This manipulation led one group to have full bladders and the other group relatively empty (urgency).
#' Later on, these participants were given eight trials on which they had to choose between a small financial
#' reward that they would receive soon (SS) or a large financial reward for which they would wait longer (LL).
#' They counted how many trials participants choose the LL reward as an indicator of inhibitory control (ll_sum). The data contains three variables:
#'
#'   * **id**: participant ID
#'   * **urgency**: whether participants were in a high urination urgency condition (they drank everything) or a low urgency condition (they took sips of water)

#' Van Bourg et al. (2020) data
#'
#' A dataset from Field, A. P. (2026). Discovering statistics using R and RStudio (2nd ed.). London: Sage.
#'
#' Pet dogs often engage in behaviours helpful to their owners (mine likes to cuddle me when I've had a bad day, and in fact when I've had a good day, and now I think of it, pretty much any day regardless of how good or bad its been).
#' It's unclear whether these behaviours are truly prosocial. Can a dog engage in prosocial behaviours that haven't been explicitly trained?
#' Bourg et al (2020) addressed this question by trapping some dog's owners in boxes! In the study 60 dogs were tested in three conditions all of which involved being in a room with large restrainer box
#' (a large acrylic box with holes in the side that could be closed by resting a foam board door across its opening). Each dog had three experiences in the room and each time the experimenters were interested in whether the dog would open the restrainer box within 120 seconds.
#' The order of the 3 experiences was counterbalanced so different dogs completed the experiences in different orders.
#'
#' * The **food** condition: food was dropped into the restrainer. This condition was to test whether the dog was capable of moving the foam board door to open the box (to get the food).
#' * The distress condition: the dogs' owner was placed in the restrainer and was instructed to call for help in a distressed tone.
#' * The reading condition: the dogs' owner was placed in the restrainer and was instructed to read from a magzine at the same pace and in the same tone as in the distress condition.
#'
#' This data contains a subset of variables from the study, but the full dataset is available in the supplementary materials of the paper \doi{https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0231742.s001}.
#' The data contains the following variables
#'
#' * **name**: The dog's name
#' * **dog_id**: A unique identifier for each dog
#' * **condition**: Which condition the dog was participating in at the time (distress, food, reading).
#' * **test_number**: A number form 1 to 3 indicating the order in which the particular condition was administered. For example, 2 would indicate that the data relate to the second of the three tests that the dog experienced.
#' * **latency**: The time taken to open the box in seconds. If the dog did not open the box a maximum of 120s was recorded.
#' * **opened_door**: Dis the dog open the restrainer box (1 = yes, 0 = no).
