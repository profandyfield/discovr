<div style="float: right"><img src="./data-raw/images/discovr_hex.png" width="150"></div>


The `discovr` package contains resources for my 2026 textbook [Discovering Statistics Using <img src="./data-raw/images/r_logo.png" width="18"> and <img src="./data-raw/images/rstudio_logo.png" width="48">](https://www.discovr.rocks/). There are tutorials written using [learnr](https://rstudio.github.io/learnr/). Once a tutorial is running it's a bit like reading a book but with places where you can practice the <img src="./data-raw/images/r_logo.png" width="18"> code that you have just been taught. The `discovr` package is free and offered to support tutors and students using my textbook who want to learn <img src="./data-raw/images/r_logo.png" width="18">.

> **NOTE**
> Over summer 2025 the tutorials within this package were fully updated (see News).

## Installing `discovr`

To use `discovr` you first need to install <img src="./data-raw/images/r_logo.png" width="18"> and <img src="./data-raw/images/rstudio_logo.png" width="48"> and familiarise yourself with <img src="./data-raw/images/r_logo.png" width="18">, <img src="./data-raw/images/rstudio_logo.png" width="48"> and good workflow practice. You can do this using [this interactive tutorial](https://milton-the-cat.rocks/learnr/r/r_getting_started/). Once you have installed <img src="./data-raw/images/r_logo.png" width="18"> and <img src="./data-raw/images/rstudio_logo.png" width="48"> you can install `discovr`.

The current released version is available from CRAN:

```{r, eval = F}
install.packages("discovr")
```

I don't currently plan any major updates because the entire package was overhauled in 2025 to match the published version of the book. That said, minor tweaks, typo fixes and so on will be available in the development version, which can be installed using

```{r, eval = F}
if(!require(remotes)){
  install.packages('remotes')
}

remotes::install_github("profandyfield/discovr")
```


## Interactive tutorials

I recommend working through [this playlist of tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEzw67WWDg83weG3idsgy4wuOIJAashA2&si=PiI-sDvqc1DkaWOq) on how to install, set up and work within <img src="./data-raw/images/r_logo.png" width="18"> and <img src="./data-raw/images/rstudio_logo.png" width="48"> before starting the interactive tutorials.

### List of tutorials

- `discovr_01`: Introducing <img src="./data-raw/images/r_logo.png" width="18">, RStudio and Quarto: What is R, tour of RStudio and Quarto, getting help, installing packages, coding style and loading packages.
- `discovr_02`: Code fundamentals: Functions and objects, packages and functions, style, data types.
- `discovr_03`: The tidyverse: tidy and messy data, tibbles, adding and selecting variables, filtering cases.
- `discovr_04`: Summarizing data: mean, median, variance, standard deviation, interquartile range,  normal and bootstrap confidence intervals, tables of summary statistics. Includes an interactive app demonstrating what a confidence interval is.
- `discovr_05`: Visualizing data. The ggplot2 package, boxplots, plotting means, violin plots, scatterplots, grouping by colour, grouping using facets, adjusting scales, adjusting positions."
- `discovr_06`: The beast of bias. Restructuring data from messy to tidy format (and back). Spotting outliers using histograms and boxplots. Calculating *z*-scores (standardizing scores). Writing your own function. Using *z*-scores to detect outliers. Q-Q plots. Calculating skewness, kurtosis and the number of valid cases. Grouping summary statistics by multiple categorical/grouping variables.
- `discovr_07`: Associations. Plotting data with GGally. Pearson's *r*, Spearman's Rho, Kendall's tau, robust correlations. Using `display()` to round output more flexibly.
- `discovr_08`: The general linear model (GLM). Visualizing the data, fitting GLMs with one and two predictors. Viewing model parameters with broom, model parameters, standard errors, confidence intervals, fit statistics, significance.
- `discovr_09`: Categorical predictors with two categories (comparing two means). Comparing two independent means, comparing two related means, effect sizes, robust comparisons of means (independent and related), Bayes factors and estimation (independent and related means).
- `discovr_10`: Moderation and mediation. Centring variables (grand mean centring), specifying interaction terms, moderation analysis, simple slopes analysis, Johnson-Neyman intervals, mediation with one predictor, direct and indirect effects, mediation using `lavaan`.
- `discovr_11`: Comparing several means. Essentially 'One-way independent ANOVA' but taught using a general linear model framework. Covers setting contrasts (dummy coding, contrast coding, and linear and quadratic trends), the *F*-statistic and Welch's robust *F*, robust parameter estimation, heteroscedasticity-consistent tests of parameters, robust tests of means based on trimmed data, *post hoc* tests.
- `discovr_12`: Linear models involving continuous and categorical predictors. The first example looks at the case o moderation (non-paralell slopes models), whereas the second explores comparing means adjusted for other variables (a parallel slopes model or 'Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA)'). The tutorial covers setting contrasts, fitting the models, evaluating effects using *F*-statistics based on Type III sums of squares and diagnostic plots, and interpretting the model using heteroscedasticity-consistent tests of parameters and *post hoc* tests.
- `discovr_13`: Factorial designs. Fitting models for two-way factorial designs (independent measures) using `lm()`. This tutorial builds on previous ones to show how models can be fit with two categorical predictors to look at the interaction between them. We look at fitting the models, setting contrasts for the two categorical predictors, interaction plots, simple effects analysis, diagnostic plots and robust models.
- `discovr_13_afex`: Factorial designs. Fitting models for two-way factorial designs (independent measures) using the `afex` package. This tutorial takes an ANOVA approach to factorical designs. We look at fitting the models, interaction plots, simple effects analysis, diagnostic plots, partial omega-squared and robust models.
- `discovr_14`: Multilevel models. This tutorial looks at fitting multilevel models using the `glmmTMB` package (all code will also work with `lme4`). It begins with an optional section on checking and coding categorical variables before moving on to show you how to fit and interpret a multilevel model. We also look briefly at the `purrr` package.
- `discovr_15`: Repeated measures designs. Fitting models for one- and two-way repeated measures designs using the `afex` package. This tutorial builds on previous ones to show how models can be fit with one or two categorical predictors when these variables have been manipulated within the same entities. We look at fitting the models, setting contrasts for the categorical predictors, obtaining estimated marginal means, interaction plots, simple effects analysis, diagnostic plots and robust models.
- `discovr_15_growth`: Modelling change over time. Growth models using multilevel modelling and the `glmmTMB` package. (All code will also work with `lme4`.) First we explore growth over time by building up a model to include a random intercept and slope for time. We then model non-linear change using both an exponential effect of time and a polynomials. We then extend the model to an example based on a clinical trial in which a fixed effect of an intervention moderates change over time.
- `discovr_15_mlm`: Repeated measures designs. Fitting models for one- and two-way repeated measures designs using a multilevel model framework using `glmmTMB`. (All code will also work with `lme4`.) The examples match `discovr_15` but the modelling approach differs. This tutorial builds on previous ones to show how models can be fit with one or two categorical predictors when these variables have been manipulated within the same entities. We look at fitting the models, setting contrasts for the categorical predictors and diagnostic plots.
- `discovr_16`: Mixed designs. Fitting models for mixed designs using the `afex` package. This tutorial builds on previous ones to show how models can be fit with one or two categorical predictors when at least one of these variables has been manipulated within the same entities and at least one other has been manipulated using different entities. We look at fitting the models, setting contrasts for the categorical predictors, obtaining estimated marginal means, and interaction plots.
- `discovr_17`: Exploratory factor analysis (EFA). This tutorial looks at using exploratory factor analysis in the context of questionnaire design. It covers factor analysis, parallel analysis and reliability analysis using MacDonald's Omega.".
- `discovr_18`: Categorical variables. Entering categorical data, contingency tables, associations between categorical variables, the chi-square test, standardized residuals, Fisher's exact test.
- `discovr_19`: Categorical outcomes (logistic regression). This tutorial builds on previous ones to show how the general linear model model extends to situations where you want to predict a binary outcome (logistic regression). We look at fitting the models and interpreting the odds ratio.
- `discovr_19_xmas`: Christmas edition of `discovr_19` to match the lecture I give [https://youtu.be/yniFrp8vQLQ?si=DaUVAmAL6sZQ2tkT](https://youtu.be/yniFrp8vQLQ?si=DaUVAmAL6sZQ2tkT).
- `discovr_bayes`: Bayesian taster tutorial. This tutorial offers a taster of Bayesian statistics by showing how to estimate models from other tutorials within a Bayesian framework using `rstanarm`. We also look at Bayes factors. The tutorial includes five examples of linear models: (1) predicting a continuous outcome from several continuous predictors; (2) comparing two means; (3) comparing multiple means; (4) comparing means adjusted for a covariate (ANCOVA); and (5) predicting a continuous outcome from two continuous predictors (a factorial design).


### Running a tutorial

In <img src="./data-raw/images/rstudio_logo.png" width="48"> Version 1.3 onwards there is a tutorial pane. Having executed

```{r, eval = F}
library(discovr)
```

A list of tutorials appears in this pane. Scroll through them and click on the <img src="./data-raw/images/start_tutorial.png" width="64"> button to run the tutorial:

<img src="./data-raw/images/run_tutorial_pane_discovr.png" width="700">

Alternatively, to run a particular tutorial from the console execute:

```{r, eval = F}
library(discovr)
learnr::run_tutorial("name_of_tutorial", package = "discovr")
```

and replace "name of tutorial" with the name of the tutorial you want to run. For example, to run tutorial 2 execute:

```{r, eval = F}
learnr::run_tutorial("discovr_02", package = "discovr")
```

The name of each tutorial is in bold in the list above. Once the command to run the tutorial is executed it will spring to life in a web browser.

### Suggested workflow

The tutorials are self-contained (you practice code in code boxes) so you don't need to use <img src="./data-raw/images/rstudio_logo.png" width="48"> at the same time. However, to get the most from them I would recommend that you create an <img src="./data-raw/images/rstudio_logo.png" width="48"> project and within that open (and save) a new RMarkdown file each time to work through a tutorial. Within that Markdown file, replicate parts of the code from the tutorial (in code chunks) and use Markdown to write notes about what you have done, and to reflect on things that you have struggled with, or note useful tips to help you remember things. Basically, write a learning journal. This workflow has the advantage of not just teaching you the code that you need to do certain things, but also provides practice in using <img src="./data-raw/images/rstudio_logo.png" width="48"> itself.

See this video explaining my suggested workflow:

## Colour palettes

Inspired  by the [rockthemes](https://github.com/johnmackintosh/rockthemes) package and adapting code form that package I have come up with a bunch of colour themes based around the studio albums of my favourite band [Iron Maiden](https://www.ironmaiden.com). Full disclosure, I'm not a designer, so this largely involved uploading images of their sleeves to [colorpalettefromimage.com](https://colorpalettefromimage.com) and seeing what happened. If you have a better palette design send me the hex codes for the colours! If you're wondering why some albums are missing, here's the explanation: X Factor (would basically be 8 shades of gray), Fear of the Dark (shit album), The Book of Souls (would basically be 8 shades of black).

There are also colour blind accessible pallettes based on [Okabe and Ito](https://jfly.uni-koeln.de/color/) and [Paul Tol's muted palette](https://sronpersonalpages.nl/~pault/data/colourschemes.pdf).

The following palettes exist.

* `amolad_pal()`: Colour palette (8 colour) based on Iron Maiden's [A Matter of Life and Death](https://www.ironmaiden.com/studio-album/a-matter-of-life-and-death/) album sleeve. In `ggplot2` use `scale_color_amolad()` and `scale_fill_amolad()`.
* `bnw_pal()`: Colour palette (8 colour) based on Iron Maiden's [Brave New World](https://www.ironmaiden.com/studio-album/brave-new-world/) album sleeve. In `ggplot2` use `scale_color_bnw()` and `scale_fill_bnw()`.
* `dod_pal()`: Colour palette (8 colour) based on Iron Maiden's [Dance of Death](https://www.ironmaiden.com/studio-album/dance-of-death/) album sleeve. In `ggplot2` use `scale_color_dod()` and `scale_fill_dod()`.
* `frontier_pal()`: Colour palette (8 colour) based on Iron Maiden's [The Final Frontier](https://www.ironmaiden.com/studio-album/the-final-frontier/) album sleeve. In `ggplot2` use `scale_color_frontier()` and `scale_fill_frontier()`.
* `im_pal()`: Colour palette (8 colour) based on Iron Maiden's [eponymous](https://www.ironmaiden.com/studio-album/iron-maiden/) album sleeve. In `ggplot2` use `scale_color_im()` and `scale_fill_im()`.
* `killers_pal()`: Colour palette (8 colour) based on Iron Maiden's [Killers](https://www.ironmaiden.com/studio-album/killers/) album sleeve. In `ggplot2` use `scale_color_killers()` and `scale_fill_killers()`.
* `nob_pal()`: Colour palette (8 colour) based on Iron Maiden's [The Number of the Beast](https://www.ironmaiden.com/studio-album/the-number-of-the-beast/) album sleeve. In `ggplot2` use `scale_color_nob()` and `scale_fill_nob()`.
* `okabe_ito_pal`: Colourblind-friendly palette (8 colour) from [Okabe and Ito](https://jfly.uni-koeln.de/color/). In `ggplot2` use `scale_color_oi()` and `scale_fill_oi()`.
* `pom_pal()`: Colour palette (8 colour) based on Iron Maiden's [Piece of Mind](https://www.ironmaiden.com/studio-album/piece-of-mind/) album sleeve. In `ggplot2` use `scale_color_pom()` and `scale_fill_pom()`.
* `power_pal()`: Colour palette (8 colour) based on Iron Maiden's [Powerslave](https://www.ironmaiden.com/studio-album/powerslave/) album sleeve. In `ggplot2` use `scale_color_power()` and `scale_fill_power()`.
* `prayer_pal()`: Colour palette (8 colour) based on Iron Maiden's [No Prayer for the Dying](https://www.ironmaiden.com/studio-album/no-prayer-for-the-dying/) album sleeve. Use `scale_color_prayer()` and `scale_fill_prayer()`.
* `senjutsu_pal()`: Colour palette (10 colour) based on the inner gatefold image of Iron Maiden's [Senjutsu album](https://www.ironmaiden.com/studio-album/senjutsu/) album sleeve. In `ggplot2` use `scale_color_senjutsu()` and `scale_fill_senjutsu()`.
* `sit_pal()`: Colour palette (8 colour) based on Iron Maiden's [Somewhere in Time](https://www.ironmaiden.com/studio-album/somewhere-in-time/) album sleeve. In `ggplot2` use `scale_color_sit()` and `scale_fill_sit()`.
* `ssoass_pal()`: Colour palette (8 colour) based on Iron Maiden's [Seventh Son of a Seventh Son](https://www.ironmaiden.com/studio-album/seventh-son-of-a-seventh-son/) album sleeve. In `ggplot2` use `scale_color_ssoass()` and `scale_fill_ssoass()`.
* `virtual_pal()`: Colour palette (8 colour) based on Iron Maiden's [Virtual IX](https://www.ironmaiden.com/studio-album/virtual-xi/) album sleeve. In `ggplot2` use `scale_color_virtual()` and `scale_fill_virtual()`.

To view the palette execute

```{r, eval = F}
scales::show_col(name_of_palette()(8))
```

Replacing `name_of_palette()` with the name, for example

```{r, eval = F}
scales::show_col(pom_pal()(8))
```

To apply, for example, the Powerslave palette to the colours of a `ggplot2` plot add `scale_color_power()` as a layer:

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

# Get albums in the classic era from the discovr::eddiefy data.
# I'm not including fear of the dark because it's not in any way classic.
# No prayer for the dying was pushing its luck too if I'm honest.

classic_era <- subset(discovr::eddiefy, year < 1992)
 
ggplot(classic_era, aes(x = energy, y = valence, color = album_name)) +
  geom_point(size = 2) +
  discovr::scale_color_power() +
  theme_minimal()
```

Similarly to apply the Powerslave palette to the fill of objects in a ggplot add `scale_fill_power()` as a layer:

```{r}
ggplot(classic_era, aes(x = album_name, y = valence, fill = album_name)) +
  geom_violin() +
  discovr::scale_fill_power() + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45)) +
  theme_minimal()
```
