    workflow in 'R' and 'RStudio', summarizing data, visualizing data,
    fitting models and bias, correlation, the general linear model (GLM),
    moderation, mediation, missing values, comparing means using the GLM
    (analysis of variance), comparing adjusted means (analysis of covariance), factorial
    designs, multilevel models, repeated measures designs, growth models, exploratory factor analysis (EFA), loglinear analysis, and logistic regression.
