0.1-6	2026-02-02
   o	updated URL in dataURI documentation


0.1-5	2026-02-01
   o	remove SETLENGTH in R 4.5.0+ to be API-compliant

   o	add strict decoding mode, enabled with strict=TRUE (#5)


0.1-4	2022-03-16
   o	add support for long vectors. Note that R does not
	support strings longer than 2^31-1 bytes, so when
	encoding long vectors a line limit has to be specified.

   o	add compatibility for R versions without XLENGTH()

   o	allow raw vector as input in base64decode()

   o	fix failure in base64decode(..., output = 'foo') (#2)


0.1-3	2015-07-27
   o	add checkUTF8() which checks the validity of a raw vector
	for use as a UTF8 string


0.1-2	2014-06-26
   o	bugfix: encoding content of more than 65536 bytes without
	linebreaks produced padding characters between chunks because
	chunk size was not divisible by three.


0.1-1	2012-11-05
   o	fix a bug in base64decode where output is a file name

   o	add base64decode(file=...) as a (non-leaking) shorthand for
	base64decode(file(...))


0.1-0	2012-09-07
   o	initial CRAN release
